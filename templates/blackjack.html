	<h1>Blackjack Rules & Tips</h1>
	<p>Welcome to Blackjack! Here are some basic rules and tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The goal of Blackjack is to acquire a hand as close to 21 as possible, beating the dealer in the process.</li>
		<li>When the game gets underway, you are dealt two cards. You need to decide whether to stand (stick with the cards that you have been dealt) or hit (receive another card from the dealer).</li>
		<li>You can stand with anything that is 21 or under, but be careful – stand with a hand that is too low and the dealer is likely to beat you to 21.</li>
		<li>If you decide to hit, you will receive another card from the dealer. Be careful though, if you take a risk and hit with a hand that is close to 21 already, you might go bust. Working out when to hit and when to stand is crucial to your Blackjack strategy and will help you win more hands than you lose at the table.</li>
		<li>While it’s tempting to go for 21 every time, standing with a hand of 17 or better can be a smart move as it keeps you in the game.</li>
		<li>***The dealer must hit until reaching at least 17.***</li>
	</ul>
