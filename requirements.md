## Project Name:

- TIV (The Idiot’s Village)

## Business Context:

- All people of any IQ lower than 100 should be able to feel safe using this social media platform to connect with friends, pass time, make money, and find true love <3

## Problem Statement:
- Our mission is to create a stress-free and intuitive social media platform for individuals who feel overwhelmed or out of place on current platforms. 
Social media platforms often create an environment where users are comparing themselves to others, especially in terms of intellect and social status. This can lead to people feeling judged, inadequate or inferior. For some people, these comparisons can hinder their ability to express themselves.
